Attendees:

- Tamas Ban
- David Brown
- Andrzej Puzdrowski (nvlsianpu)
- Fabio Utzig
- Michel Jaouen
- Roman Okhrimenko
- David Vincze

Agenda:

- Agenda bashing
- Zephyr not moving to Mbed TLS 3.0 until after 2.7.
- Travis, and FIH tests
- 1.8 release

Topics:

- Travis, FIH test
  Tamas to get someone to resolve this
  - Fabio mcu-tools has a fork of TF-M to use
  - Start making it work again in Travis, then look to migrating to GH
    workflow
- Need to get a FIH build without testing
  - Andrzej to investigate
- Patch from Renesas re larger alignment
  - No simulator tests, so we don't know about when resets
  - Will not work with MCU manager (MCU manager will assume 8 bytes
    still)
  - Using updated magic for non 8-byte alignment
    - when 8, use existing magic
    - when other, use different 14-byte magic, and add 2 bytes at the
      end of magic to indicate the alignment used.
  - Work needs to be done on 'main', not on 1.7.
- v1.8
  - Need FIH fixes (ideally with Travis/GH tests) and build tests
  - Whether alignment is done depends on timing.

Actions:
- Fabio to investigate simulator tests for larger alignment patch and
  inform David if unable
- David to add an FIH build to GH Workflow CI
- Tamas to have someone get Travis FIH testing working
- David or Fabio to convert Travis FIH test to GH workflow
