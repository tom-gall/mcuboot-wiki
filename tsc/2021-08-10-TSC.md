Topics

- v1.8: Once we work through the existing pending pull requests, tag a
  v1.8.0-rc1.
- No objections to release GHSA with just an advisory and no code
  changes, while a github issue can track any code changes to remove
  private keys from the repo
- SUIT Proposal
  - Idea of preparsed manifests
  - To enable smoother transition to SUIT, propose making making
    MCUboot parse hard-coded manifests and continue with its current
    processing code.  Two approaches
    - Cache this data in the download client, and store in the TLV,
      with pointers to the manifest for details.
      - Doesn't increase code size in MCUboot
      - download clients have extra functionality
      - Difficult for downloads done via serial recovery, or JTAG
    - Have a first step in MCUboot that parses a hard-coded manifest,
      placing in RAM (possibly in TLV form).  Loader then does what it
      would normally do, but without needing to verify signatures.
  - Further discussion needed.
