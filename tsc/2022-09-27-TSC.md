## Attendees

- David Brown (d3zd3z)
- Dominik (de-nordic)
- Greg Shue (gregshue)
- Tamas Ban (tamban)

## Agenda

- Conversation concerning #1411
  - Build system refactoring
  - Helps make MCUboot act more as a module in Zephyr
  - David ok with change, would like some feedback from Andrzej
- Need to work through about 25 PRs (90 two weeks ago)
- Will make a release before considering some major ideas
- Bigger ideas
  - `flash_area_open` and associated close happen a lot, can this be
    done once.
  - Cleanup and better organization of functionality, so conditional
    compilation decisions aren't woven through code as much
  - Organization into separate modules that can be better tested
  - With future impact (see [last TSC](tsc/2022-09-13-TSC.md)):
    - Large block support
    - SUIT
