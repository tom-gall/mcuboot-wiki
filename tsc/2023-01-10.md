## Agenda

## Topics

- Dominik discussing converting to a single flash area open per slot
  instead of lots of open/closes throughout the code.
  - Saves some flash size.
  - Still need to figure out bootutil-public interface.
  - Considerations for more improvements, single header that defines
    things that are needed in one place.

- Tamas: Arm has a resource to work on MCUboot
  - Add PSA crypto API support
  - Code improvement, code cleanup and organization.

- David: Move to discord?
  - Slack is expensive to get any more features.
  - Discord free is probably enough.
  - Created discord, will nudge people there.
  - Can discuss later if we want to more permanently move.

- Build and module changes?
  - David would like to be able to have a project directory that
    builds mcuboot with possible changes to settings.

- There is a PR 1528 to improve fault injection
  - Improves medium level fault injection to be more resilient to
    instruction skips.

## Actions
