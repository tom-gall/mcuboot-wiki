# MCUboot TSC 2023-01-10

## Attendees

- David Brown (d3zd3z)
- Tamas Ban (tamban)

## Agenda

## Topics

- Fault Injection hardening PR 1528

- Tamas: Arm has a resource to work on MCUboot
  - Add PSA crypto API support
  - Debugging some issues
    - PSA crypto appears to not be re-entrant, tests by default are
      multi-threaded.  Could make tests single threaded, but slows CI
      down significantly.
  - TLV entries are specific to the curve, and wishes to consider
    adding a general TLV entry where the curve is a parameter.

- David: Move to discord?
  - Just a few joined, give it some time.

## Actions

- David: Review 1528
