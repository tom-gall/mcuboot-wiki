Agenda:

- GHSA-gcxh-546h-phg4

Topics:

- Dominik: proposing tagging issues/prs with port labels, core, and potentially
  security in the future.
- Andrzej: Zephyr not yet at Mbed TLS 3.0.  This is in process, and
  should be done soon.
- GHSA: Bug at github prevented us from being able to edit this. David
  B reported this, and github fixed it within a few hours.  This can
  now be released.
- v1.8: use milestones in github.  The 1.8.0 label is applied to some
  very old changes, and will be ignored for now.  People should add
  the milestone to any changes that need to go into the release.

Actions:

- David B: Update and release GHSA
- David B: Create labels for ports
- David B: Release 1.8.0-rc1
