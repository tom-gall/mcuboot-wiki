- TFM v1.4 final tag?  They are happy with RC2.
  - David V will ask if this should be final, and one of us will make
    final tag.
- 1.8 release
  - hooks should merge
  - encrypted ramload testing ideally
  - we will go through and add 1.8.0 milestone to PRs
- Previous branches
  - First scenario, if only in branch, should we push
  - What if still on main branch
  - David V to look through main branch for any other things to cherry
    pick.
  - David B will tag an 1.7.3-rc1.
- Issue #1066: `boot_set_confirmed` not working as expected
  - read and write of status are inconsistent
  - suggested fix: Change read of status to return "confirmed" if
    there is no magic.  Needs testing an analysis to see if it will
    work.
- SUIT
  - Hannes presented slides and summary of hackathon
