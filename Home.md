Secure boot for 32-bit Microcontrollers!

MCUboot is a secure bootloader for 32-bit MCUs. The goal of MCUboot is to define a common infrastructure for the bootloader, system flash layout on microcontroller systems, and to provide a secure bootloader that enables easy software upgrade.

MCUboot is operating system and hardware independent, and relies on hardware porting layers from the operating system it works with. Currently MCUboot works with both the Apache Mynewt, and Zephyr operating systems, but more ports are planned in the future. RIOT is currently supported as a boot target with a complete port planned.
